**This is my first post !**

And I am happy I have made it this far, it is an uphill battle for me to configure config files and try to make sure that the themes and the layout of the site is appealing. I am hoping I will be able to write more and be more descriptive and clear about my ideas and opinions. I hope I will be able to write daily, does not have to be great material just something about how life's going on and to discuss things that are important to me with people that might also like give importance to the same things. 

I think what I am trying to say is that I want this site to be an outlet. An outlet of emotions so that the knowledge and the ideas that have been building up pressure inside of me for years now find a way to be dispersed, into thin air and find their way into other peoples thought processes. I think the more that I keep inside of me the less I will be able to accumulate. If the cup of my conciousness is already filled up, anymore information or knowledge or thinking will lead to an overflow and will not be retained. I need to give my ideas a permanent place where they can stay forever, it will also allow be to self reflect and realise the movement in my thought process over the years and how I have developed gradually over my lifespan
