<h3>A Tale of Pain and Regret</h3>
<p>
I have just been through one of the most painfull phases of my life. 
</p>

<p>
It has been very painfull looking back at the last year and thinking about what all I could have done to improve my situation today, it may not be very stoic of me to do so, to feel pain about things over which I now have no control but I cannot bring myself to do anything about it. Before I go on further let me provide some much needed context. I had decided I wanted pursue Law and that is why I researched and found out that I must clear this examination called Common Law Addmission Test or CLAT, which provides me an opportuanity to get an admission in a prestigious National Law University.
</p>

<p>
I knew this is what I wanted to do when I was in Class 11 and so I had 2 years to prepare for this exam. Here is where my first mistake occurred. Let me introduce you to the Parkinson Principle (the term might be wrong I tried to remember it off the top of my head), the idea here is that work occupies the time that is given for the same. I had now given myself 2 years to prepare for the exam, and had not realised that this was detrimental to my own success because in the grand list of things that needed to be done preparing for CLAT was the least of my worries for the first year of the preparation. If I had controlled this in the first place I would have a strong foundation to build upon in the next year, but because I got nothing done I had to begin from scratch in the next year. One could also argue that the COVID 19 pandemic also played a part in disrupting my year but that is a worthless argument, (for me) because I had literally no issues, I stayed home all day and spent time doing shit on my laptop, when I could have been working and getting something valuable out the time I had.
</p>

<p>
The next year began with this superimposition of pressure and tension upon us unsuspecting toddlers by the nightmare factory called school. I was told a 120 times a day to take care of my academics because I was now in the 12 Grade. I got confused and stared for way too long in the eyes of the Medusa, I got sucked into academic studies, thus considering both CLAT and Class 12 BOARDS the admission test again assumed a lower priority. I also got heavily into gaming which again took a very large chunk off my time. I was literally fighting against time here but my inability to understand how deep I was into the shit that I had adopted into my life made me ignorant. I was in a euphoria thinking "Oh well, Ill do this tom morrow but that never came". I gave my academic exams and was very happy with the results too but I had still not given any importance to CLAT. I knew what they asked in the exam but nothing else, I had not practised and was not ready for what was in store for me. 
</p>

<p>
I got into panic mode. 
It was sick, I was fighting against time again and had not learnt anything from my previous experience's. I had one week and a lot to do. I worked as hard as I could leaving no stone unturned. I was reminded of the sermon Lord Krishna gave in the Gita where he said work hard but donot care about the fruits of your labour, because they are in the hands of the Lord. But it still was not consolation because the initial requirement to his sermon was for man to do his bit as best as he could but I had not done even that. I gave the exam thinking about the chain of events that brought me here and the sheer regret that came with it. If only I had kept this in mind, If only I had done x, y and z my situation today would have been better. 
</p>

<p>
I was surprised on the day the results came, I had received an AIR or 2519 out of the 50-70,000 people that had given the exam. It was a very nice rank for what its worth and maybe I wont get a NLU but I was eligible for admission in a very good private law colleges. I was happy but I could not help but think I would have received a much better rank, a much better score and even an opportunity to go a NLU if only I had kept a few key things in mind. I could not help but notice if I could achieve such a great rank in 7 days what all I could have achieved if I just studied all through the year and kept a cohesive and well though out plan for the same. I failed at realising the value of setting priorities and taming distraction. 
</p>

<p>
I am an actual victim of my own negligence and procrastination.
