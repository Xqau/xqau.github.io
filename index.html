    <h2>What is This ?</h2>
    <p>A blog where I write on a mixed bag of different topics and ideas that come up while reading texts from topics ranging from Technology to Philosophy, I am a student of Law but love to read on a variety of topics. You might even find some articles on the Law if you'r lucky :-). I try to keep the topics and the blog posts simple and easy to understand but if you would like to demand further clarification or wish to comment on the article you can email me at <b>kjani@member.fsf.org</b> </p>
