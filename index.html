Hello Traveller,
<br>
I hope the journey till here was not very tiring but now that you have reached your final destination I must applaud you and welcome you to this secluded abode of mine. As you might have already noticed I was expecting you. Why you ask ?? Mostly because I must divulge all this knowledge that I have accumulated over my ongoing struggle in life to someone worthy, someone who would traverse the stormy oceans of biased media, bloated websites and silly games to come here and be part of a group of this small community of internet neck beards. Old Veterans who yearn for older and simpler times when the internet was much more about information and its democratisation rather than information and its monetisation.

This website is a personal blog of Krishna Jani, a well renowned scholar in the subtle art of sarcasm. In addition to that he is also interested in the humanities and writes about whatever shit comes to mind. This is not a website you might visit to feel "intelligent and big brained", if you ask me I would treat this ugly website as a way of winding down sometimes, mostly after a bad day from school or work so as to feel unburdened by the problems of life.
