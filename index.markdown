**Hi !** 

**Nice to meet you !**

Welcome to this small part of the internet that I own and maintain, it contains my ideas, my thoughts and my opinions which may or may not appeal to you which is why this is a humble disclaimer to take what I say with a grain of salt and to realise that at the end of the day they are opinions of some random dude on the internet

### Who Am I ??

While the heading may seem a little misleading this is blog is in fact written and maintained by a real human and is not some super intelligent AI taking about philosophy and politics. My name is **Krishna Jani** and I live in a small city called Udaipur in the northeastern province of Rajasthan. As I have talked about in my first post it is important for everyone to have a small outlet of ideas and opinions be it in any way or form which is why I run this website. If you do have fun and enjoy your stay here you can tell me all about it using the following means of communication

- **Email** = *janikrishna2005@gmail.com*
- **Twitter** = *krishnajani2005* (not very active though)
- You can alternatively also open an issue on Github = [Repository](https://github.com/xqau/xqau.github.com)
