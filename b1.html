<h1>Internet and Minimalism</h1>
<h4>================================</h4>

<h3> Huh ? </h4> 

<p>
I dont blame you for reacting this way when you first hear the words Internet and Minimalism together. In places like the USA the 2 words have been banned for use together mostly because it was considered offensive to the big Silicon Valley corporations that exist in San Francisco. And so at the cost of being tried for treason I must tell the world what and why is minimalism and simplicity a important need in our modern times.

<p>
Now before I talk about why I think it is important for the internet to simple, let us do a small experiment. In this experiment I want you to time the approximate seconds it takes to load my site and sites like CNN, BBC and Reuters. Go on, dont be scared they wont bite you. And when you are done think about why and what made my site load faster. Was it the lack of colors, the lack of good looking text and bright buttons that invite you to click on them ? The answer is that I did not wish to make money off you visiting this website. The text that you are seeing right now is devoid of any decorations, any colors and is simply what the internet should have been. A way for people to distribute information, ideas and thoughts. Today large media corporations like Google, Facebook, BBC etc are embedding trackers and other malicious items into their source code and thus when you an unsuspecting visitor enters the site you are bombarded with advertisements. The peculiar thing about these advertisements is that they are dangerously similar to the recent searches and queries you put on the internet.  Maybe you wanted to buy a new cover for the phone you have and try to find a suitable one on amazon only to find several alternatives popping up as advertisements when you are browsing a  weather station website.

Their motive here is simple, they wish to make a neat profit out of people that visit their website and view their content. While the motive maybe one that is justified the means to the end are not at all okay considering how these corporations will now use our data against us by creating marketing campaigns closely modeled after our needs and preferences tricking our brain into buying the cheap shit they make. I would have been fine with a paywall over the content they offer but clearly their management would not have been content with those earnings alone.
This is where by website comes in. The site in itself is a protest. A protest against the corporations that have destroyed the internet trying to scrape off every dollar they can from unsuspecting and innocent individuals. We must try and yearn to create an internet one day that is based on the objectives of providing everyone with free access to information, a place for people to come together and voice their opinions and for people to unleash their creativity.

The internet itself is free of the bonds of humanity, it does not have the constrains of society that bind other forms of media like books and movies. Thus we must make the internet a liberating platform where everything is simple, minimal and accessible. We must regain control over the internet, control that has been taken away from us by these companies. I urge everyone reading this to try and create similar websites where you too like me can voice your opinions and make your ideas public, where you too can protest against this coup staged by corporations and to reinstate our, <b> the peoples </b> control over the internet
